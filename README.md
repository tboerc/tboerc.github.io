## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ blog/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ i18n/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ schemas/
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Astro will also look for `.md` files inside `src/content/blog/` directory. Each file will become a blog post.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro components.

All the internationalization stuff lives inside the `src/i18n/` directory. There we can find some helpers functions and some `.json` files containing all translated strings used in the site.

There are some validation in the frontmatter of blog posts, and `src/schemas` holds the files containing it.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
